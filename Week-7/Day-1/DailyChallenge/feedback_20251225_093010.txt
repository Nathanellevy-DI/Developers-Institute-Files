suggestions for improvement:
- The code sets up the Express app and uses a router, which is a good start, but it doesn't implement any of the specific quiz logic requested in the instructions (GET /quiz, POST /quiz, GET /quiz/score, tracking score, providing feedback, handling questions).
- The code only includes the app setup and router mounting, and it requires the route implementation inside the `quizRouter` file.

suggestions for improvement:
- Consider using a session to manage the game state if you want to support multiple users.
- Input sanitization could be added to prevent potential issues, although it's not strictly necessary for this hard-coded example.
