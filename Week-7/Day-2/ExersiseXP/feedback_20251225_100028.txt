suggestions for improvement:
- The submitted code snippet only contains database configuration, not the complete implementation of the RESTful API as described in Exercises 1 and 2. It lacks the Express app setup, route definitions, controller logic, and model definitions that are central to the exercises.
- The database configuration is minimal, lacking migrations and seeds which are standard practices. Consider adding those for a more robust setup.

suggestions for improvement:
- Implement error handling in each controller function to catch potential database errors.
- Add validation middleware to check the request body for create and update routes.
- Consider using a more robust method for handling sensitive data, such as environment variables for database credentials.
- Implement pagination for the GET /posts route to handle large datasets efficiently.
- Ensure proper input sanitization to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities.

suggestions for improvement:
- The provided code snippet only defines the routes. To fully address the exercises, you need to include the implementation of the controllers, models, and database connection using Knex.
- The code does not include any database connection or Knex usage, which is a key requirement of the exercises.

URL: https://github.com/Nathanellevy-DI/Developers-Institute-Files/blob/main/Week-7/Day-2/ExersiseXP/Exercise1/blog-api/server/server.js
suggestions for improvement:
- The code sets up a basic Express server and includes error handling, fulfilling some requirements of Exercise 1. However, it lacks database integration using Knex, and the directory structure is not fully implemented. Exercise 2 is completely unaddressed.
- The code does not create the specified directory structure (server, config, controllers, models, routes). This should be implemented.
- Knex is not used to query data from a database as specified in the learning objectives. This is a major omission.
- The code needs to implement the CRUD operations (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) for blog posts as outlined in Exercise 1, including database interactions.
- Separate route files into the 'routes' directory as indicated in instruction number 8 of exercise 1

URL: https://github.com/Nathanellevy-DI/Developers-Institute-Files/blob/main/Week-7/Day-2/ExersiseXP/Exercise2/server/app.js
suggestions for improvement:
- The code is missing the database connection setup using Knex, as described in the chapter content.
- The directory structure is not yet implemented, but implied it should be.
- Error handling is missing, specifically handling of invalid routes and server errors.
- The data persistence aspect of storing books and posts to a database is missing, currently it is just a basic API setup.

URL: https://github.com/Nathanellevy-DI/Developers-Institute-Files/blob/main/Week-7/Day-2/ExersiseXP/Exercise2/server/controllers/books.controller.js
suggestions for improvement:
- The code only implements READ ALL, READ ONE, and CREATE routes. Implement UPDATE and DELETE routes to fully address Exercise 2.
- Consider using a more robust method for generating unique IDs for books, rather than `Date.now()`, especially in a production environment.
- Implement the directory structure specified in the exercise. The provided code snippet doesn't demonstrate the suggested server/config/controllers/models/routes structure.

URL: https://github.com/Nathanellevy-DI/Developers-Institute-Files/blob/main/Week-7/Day-2/ExersiseXP/Exercise2/server/models/posts.model.js
suggestions for improvement:
- The provided code snippet only includes the models (or data access layer) for the blog API. To fully address Exercise 1 and Exercise 2, you need to provide the Express routes, controllers, and server setup, along with the database configuration.
- Consider adding input validation and sanitization in the controller layer to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities.
- Implement error handling within each function to catch database errors and return appropriate HTTP status codes.

URL: https://github.com/Nathanellevy-DI/Developers-Institute-Files/blob/main/Week-7/Day-2/ExersiseXP/Exercise2/server/routes/books.routes.js
suggestions for improvement:
- Implement the missing PUT and DELETE routes to fully satisfy the CRUD requirements outlined in Exercise 2.
- Add error handling within the controller functions (e.g., in `books.controller.js`) to handle cases where a book is not found or when there are issues during creation or update.
- Consider using a database for persistent storage instead of in-memory data, which is essential for a real-world API as suggested by both Exercise 1 and Exercise 2.
