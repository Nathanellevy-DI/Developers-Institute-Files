suggestions for improvement:
- The code only implements the colorful-message.js part of Task 2. It needs to include greeting.js, app.js for tasks 1 and 2, read-file.js, creation of files directory and text file, and challenge.js to fully address the problem.
- Consider adding comments to explain the purpose of the function, especially if the logic becomes more complex.
