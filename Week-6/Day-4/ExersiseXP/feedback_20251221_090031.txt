URL: https://github.com/Nathanellevy-DI/Developers-Institute-Files/blob/main/Week-6/Day-4/ExersiseXP/exercise-2/data.js
suggestions for improvement:
- This code snippet only contains the `data.js` file from Exercise 2. The `app.js` file, which is crucial for calculating and displaying the average age, is missing. Therefore, the exercise is incomplete.
- To fully address Exercise 2, you need to provide the `app.js` file that imports the `people` array, calculates the average age, and prints it to the console.
