suggestions for improvement:
- Consider adding docstrings to your classes and methods to explain their purpose and usage.
- For improved readability, add blank lines to separate logical code blocks within functions.
Brief justification:
- correctness: All four exercises are correctly implemented, addressing all requirements of the chapter content, including class creation, instantiation, method definition, and attribute handling, as well as conditional statements and list/dictionary manipulation. Exercise 4 also properly implements the bonus requirement to accept *args.
- readability: The code is well-structured and generally easy to follow. Variable names are descriptive, and the code is adequately commented. Minor improvements can be made by adding docstrings and blank lines to further enhance readability.
- performance: The code demonstrates good performance, using appropriate data structures and algorithms for the given tasks. The `sort_animals` method in Exercise 4 could potentially be optimized for very large lists, but it's efficient enough for the problem's scope.
- security: There are no apparent security concerns in the code. It doesn't interact with external resources or handle user input in a way that could create vulnerabilities.
