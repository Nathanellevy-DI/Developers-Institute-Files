Brief justification:
- correctness: The code accurately implements all the required steps and bonus steps. The `Farm` class is created, `__init__`, `add_animal`, `get_info`, `get_animal_types`, and `get_short_info` methods are all correctly implemented as described in the problem description. The `add_animal` method also implements the bonus step of using `**kwargs`. The code produces the correct output and handles edge cases such as pluralizing animal names correctly.
- readability: The code is well-formatted and easy to read. Variable names are descriptive, and the code is well-commented.
- performance: The code is efficient and performs well. It uses appropriate data structures and algorithms to achieve the desired functionality.
- security: There are no security concerns with the code provided.
