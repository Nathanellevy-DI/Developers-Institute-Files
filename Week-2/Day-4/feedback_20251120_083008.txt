Brief justification:
- correctness: The code fully and accurately implements both exercises as described in the chapter content. It addresses file handling, random sentence generation, input validation, JSON parsing, modification, and saving, aligning perfectly with the instructions provided. Both exercises are fully functional.
- readability: The code is well-structured and easy to understand. The comments clearly indicate each step, and the function and variable names are descriptive.
- performance: The code demonstrates good performance. Operations such as reading files, generating random sentences, and manipulating JSON data are done efficiently.
- security: The code includes error handling for file operations and input validation, contributing to its security. It appropriately handles potential exceptions, such as `FileNotFoundError`, and validates user input to prevent unexpected behavior.
