Brief justification:
- correctness: The code accurately implements all the required functionalities as described in the chapter content, including the `Pagination` class, its methods (`__init__`, `get_visible_items`, `go_to_page`, `first_page`, `last_page`, `next_page`, `previous_page`, `__str__`), and the test cases. The bonus method chaining requirement is also correctly implemented. The code handles edge cases such as invalid page numbers, empty item lists, and navigation at the boundaries (first and last pages) as specified in the instructions.
- readability: The code is well-structured and easy to understand, with clear variable names, comments explaining the purpose of each method and step, and consistent indentation. The use of optional parameters and default values enhances readability. Using `return self` enables the method chaining bonus requirement.
- performance: The code exhibits good performance, utilizing list slicing, `math.ceil` for calculating the total number of pages, and conditional logic for navigation, all of which are efficient operations for this task. The navigation methods only update the current page index, avoiding unnecessary computations when possible.
- security: The code does not involve any external inputs or operations that could pose a security risk. It properly validates page numbers to prevent out-of-range access, mitigating potential errors.
