suggestions for improvement:
- The code only provides the HTML form structure for the POST method example. It needs to include the GET method form as well, as specified in Exercise 1.
- The code lacks the JavaScript for converting the marioGame object to JSON and pretty printing it.
- There's no implementation for adding breakpoints and inspecting the JSON object in the debugger. That part of the instructions has been skipped.
