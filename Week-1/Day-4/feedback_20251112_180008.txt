suggestions for improvement:
- The code is well-structured and follows all requirements. Consider adding more robust input validation to handle edge cases (e.g., extremely large prices, non-numeric input where numbers are expected).
- The code could benefit from more comments, especially in the `run_coffee_shop` function, to explain the program's flow.
Brief justification:
- correctness: The code accurately implements all the required functions: `show_menu`, `add_item`, `update_price`, `delete_item`, `show_options`, and `run_coffee_shop`. It also handles edge cases such as empty menus, existing items, and invalid user input, as described in the problem statement. The program flow matches the example provided.
- readability: The code is generally well-readable due to its clear function definitions and docstrings. The use of blank lines enhances readability.
- performance: The code's performance is adequate for the task. The operations are relatively simple, and the data structure used (dictionary) provides efficient lookups.
- security: The code includes basic input validation (e.g., checking for negative prices and non-numeric input), which reduces the risk of errors due to unexpected user input. However, it doesn't implement more advanced security measures, which are not explicitly required in this problem.
