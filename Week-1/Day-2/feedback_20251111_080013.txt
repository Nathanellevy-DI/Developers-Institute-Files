Brief justification:
- correctness: The code correctly implements all the exercises as described in the chapter content. Each exercise performs the required operations on the specified data structures and adheres to the given instructions. For example, Exercise 1 correctly creates and manipulates sets. Exercise 3 accurately uses list methods, and so on.
- readability: The code is well-organized and easy to read. It includes clear comments to identify each exercise and uses descriptive variable names. The consistent use of print statements with separators enhances readability.
- performance: The code's performance is efficient for the given tasks. The use of appropriate data structures and algorithms (e.g., set operations, list methods, loops) ensures that each exercise executes in a reasonable amount of time. There are no obvious performance bottlenecks.
- security: The code does not involve any external data or user input that could pose a security risk. The input validation in Exercise 6 helps to prevent errors, but overall, the code does not directly address security concerns, which is acceptable given the nature of the exercises.
